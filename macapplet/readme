This folder is an attempt to make an applet using py2app.
However, this does not work well yet.

For now, a user can use launch_piScope.app, which is
a apple script and made an app using Automator

How to make applet

This directory contains files needed to an applet for MacOS.
setup.py was made using py2app
launch_piscope is automator applicaiton to launch piscope
Presently, only alias mode works.

1) run setup.py script 
(alias mode) python2.7 setup.py py2app -A  --use-pythonpath

2) to run piscope, do either one of followings
   1) launch_piscope.app
   2) Run the following from Terminal.app
    ./dist/piscope.app/Contents/MacOS/piscope 
   3) you can also click ./dist/piscope.app. However in this case, 
      you need to click dock icon...somehow...

3) external utilities
   1) ghostscript, ps2pdf (in case of macport, sudo port install ghostscript)
