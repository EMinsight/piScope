################## 
 piScope is a python based workbench for data analysis and modeling.
 Goal of piScope includes

   * To provide data analysis enviroment (= an integration of python
     shell, data structure browser, and matplotlib figure)
   * To allow uaser to edit matploblib based figures through gui.
   * To build a data browsing (scope) for MDSplus data system.
   * To provide lego blocks for gluing up large simulation codes 
     by python

 Note that piScope is not meant to be an IDE for developing a (large)
 program. Instead, it is a tool to run (and connect) such large 
 programs via python scripts.
