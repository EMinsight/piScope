	** Solid/Revolve/Surface

	The use of index array in OpenGL driver is fixed which reduces
	the number of vertices to be transfered to GPU. solid command
	accept,,,

   	1) solid(vertices)
	2) solid(vertices, index)

	1) is old version. vertices are already expanded.
	2) is equivalent to solid(vertices[index]), but internally
	it uses the index array pointer, so that CPU does not send
	duplicate vertex information to GPU.

	** API for custom figure menu palette.

	Canvas::install_navibar_palette(name, tasks,  mode = '2D'):
	Canvas::use_navibar_palette(palette_name, mode = '2D')
	Canvas::use_navibar_std_palette()

	** GLCompound to support GL artist with multiple elements

	GLCompound supports a GL artists which has multiple pickalbe
	objects. This allows for picking a different part of 3D object
	without using many FigObj.

	GLCompound::isCompound
	GLCompound::getSelectedIndex :: get which index is selected
	GLCompound::setSelectedIndex :: set which index is selected
	GLCompound::isSelected       :: called from canvas 
        GLCompound::setSelectable    :: set if artist is pickable
	GLCompound::hide_component   :: hide a part of 3D object using array_idx

	Various improvement of OpenGL graphics, which are needed
	for Petra-M
	
	** array_idx keywords to 3D solid and plot command

	array_idx is a number assigned to markers in a plot mode
	or line/triangle/rectangle in solid plot

	array_idx can be used to tell which part of 3D object is clicked.
	an element of array_idx should be between 1 and 65535

	** ArtGL::set_gl_pickable
	This can be used in order to make GL artist
	temporarilly unpickable.

	** ArtGL::LineGL caches marker texture.

	** ArtGL::get_gl_arrayid_hit
	Returns the array_idx of the elements which a user
	clicked.

        ** ArtGL::set_gl_hl_use_array_idx
	If True is give, it highlights of a part GL artist using
	array_idx data.

        ** Axes3DMod::gl_hl_setcolor
	Change highlith color. Giving [1,0,0] shows highlight in red

	** OIT (order independent transparency) renderer is enabled.
	** Videoplayer button relocation.

	A technique used to place buttons in figure canvas
	would be useful for placeig other palette-like buttons.
