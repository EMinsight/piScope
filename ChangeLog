2018
	* 1/19
	** OpenGL 3.2 based shaders are stable enough
	** fixed a few wx4 migration issues
	** turn on OpenGL by default. -g option is changed to SUPPRESS OpenGL
	** Appearance panel is modified to choose OpenGL on/off, shader version.
	
        * 1/10
        ** Migration to OpenGL 3.2 core is on-going
	Most of the functionality seems working now.
        Programs for Shader language 1.5 is named like xxxx_15.frag
	Similary MyGLCanvas has now _12 and _15 versions to support old machines.
	A gometry shader to draw thick line is added.
	Future developement will be done only on GL3.2

2017	
	* 11/27
        ** ifigure.utils.wx3to4 is added. This modules is used to absorb the API differences
	between Classic and Phoenix. Note that it is not meant for general purpose module.
	It covers only the APIs used in piScope.
	** Various adjustment/fix are maded to use wx3to4 in many modules
	** HGsupport::onHGreload is added to refresh hg folder using the repository data.
	
	* 11/07
	** GLComponent::set_gl_hl_use_array_idx, GLComponent::get_gl_hl_use_array_idx
	is modified to record the setting in setp. This allows to configure use_array_idx
	before an artist is made
	
	* 11/05
	** ArgGL::unselect_gl_artist is added to handle unselecting array_indexed
	artist correctly.
	
	* 10/28
	** Copy To Clipboard is added to CopySpecial menu
	** following interactive commands calles threed('on') automatically
	solid, revolve, surf, trisurf, surface. Note that plot command still
	does not change axes to 3D mode automatically. A user must call
	threed('on') if axes is in 2D mode.
	** fig_revolve::get_export_val is added	
        ** resolution downscaling on GPU side is added
	
	* 10/27
	** fixed an issue of 3d highlighting. refresh_hl was called
	everytime during pan/zoom/rotation.
	** ifigure_canvas.hl_color is added. Currently this property
	affect only 3D object drawing. It will be used for 2D object
	highlighting too. hl_color alpha is hard-coded to 0.65.
	** fig_surface::get_export_val is added

	
	* 10/02
	** 3D graphics in an inset axes is on
	** background alpha of 3D axes is set to transparent by default
	this is forced when calling set_3D(True), when swithching the
	mode from 2D to 3D
	** OpenGL mutlisampling
	backend_wxagg_gl has multisample and multisample_init_done to 
	control how the mutlisampling is done. A user can change setting
	from Preference->Appearance tab. When mutltisampling is off,
	it uses a texture size exactly the same as screen size. It
	saves memory, but it uses hardware smoothing, which does not look
	very good expecially when transparency is used.
	

	* 09/24
        ** navibar::ClickP1Button
	ClickP1Button(self, name) allows to click navigation
	bar button from program.
	
	* 09/22
	** set_gl_hl_use_array_idx is added to gl_component

	* 09/04

	** mode 341 (CallMethod button is added to EditList)
	This button is used to call object method. In the construction,
	string name of method should be give. An object is passed via
	SetValue to tell which object's method should be called.

	** methods to extract subset of gl_component plot data

	v, idx, cdata = gl_component::get_subset(component = None)
	gl_component::shown_component property to get shown component

	example to plot a subset of solid plot

        >> v, idx, cdata = proj.model1.mfem.mfembook.page1.axes1.face.get_subset()
        >> figure();solid(v, idx),
	
	which is equivalent to
	
	>> s = proj.model1.mfem.mfembook.page1.axes1.face.shown_component
        >> v, idx, cdata = proj.model1.mfem.mfembook.page1.axes1.face.get_subset(s)
        >> figure();solid(v, idx)

	

	** inverse keyword to gl_component::hide_component
	
	gl_component::hide_component(idx, inverse=False): if inverse is True,
	it hides everything except for the components list.
	
	
	* 08/31-2017

	** obj keyword is added to cls to delete plot selectively
	
    	   >>> figure();
    	   >>> o1 = plot(np.arange(30))
           >>> o2 = oplot(np.arange(40))
           >>> cls(obj=obj)

	
	* 08/08-20 2017

	** Solid/Revolve/Surface

	The use of index array in OpenGL driver is fixed which reduces
	the number of vertices to be transfered to GPU. solid command
	accept,,,

   	1) solid(vertices)
	2) solid(vertices, index)

	1) is old version. vertices are already expanded.
	2) is equivalent to solid(vertices[index]), but internally
	it uses the index array pointer, so that CPU does not send
	duplicate vertex information to GPU.

	** API for custom figure menu palette is added

	BookViewerFrame::install_toolbar_palette(name, tasks,  mode = '2D'):
	BookViewerFrame::use_toolbar_palette(palette_name, mode = '2D')
	BookViewerFrame::use_toolbar_std_palette()
	BookViewerFrame::refresh_toolbar_buttons()

	** GLCompound to support GL artist with multiple elements

	GLCompound supports a GL artists which has multiple pickalbe
	objects. This allows for picking a different part of 3D object
	without using many FigObj.

	GLCompound::isCompound
	GLCompound::getSelectedIndex :: get which index is selected
	GLCompound::setSelectedIndex :: set which index is selected
	GLCompound::isSelected       :: called from canvas 
        GLCompound::setSelectable    :: set if artist is pickable
	GLCompound::hide_component   :: hide a part of 3D object using array_idx
	
	* 08/04-06/2017

	Various improvement of OpenGL graphics, which are needed
	for Petra-M
	
	** array_idx keywords to 3D solid and plot command

	array_idx is a number assigned to markers in a plot mode
	or line/triangle/rectangle in solid plot

	array_idx can be used to tell which part of 3D object is clicked.
	an element of array_idx should be between 1 and 65535

	** ArtGL::set_gl_pickable
	This can be used in order to make GL artist
	temporarilly unpickable.

	** ArtGL::LineGL caches marker texture.

	** ArtGL::get_gl_arrayid_hit
	Returns the array_idx of the elements which a user
	clicked.

        ** ArtGL::set_gl_hl_use_array_idx
	If True is give, it highlights of a part GL artist using
	array_idx data.

        ** Axes3DMod::gl_hl_setcolor
	Change highlith color. Giving [1,0,0] shows highlight in red

	* 07/21/2017

	** OIT (order independent transparency) renderer is enabled.
	** Videoplayer button relocation.

	A technique used to place buttons in figure canvas
	would be useful for placeig other palette-like buttons.
