	** Solid/Revolve/Surface

	The use of index array in OpenGL driver is fixed which reduces
	the number of vertices to be transfered to GPU. solid command
	accept,,,

   	1) solid(vertices)
	2) solid(vertices, index)

	1) is old version. vertices are already expanded.
	2) is equivalent to solid(vertices[index]), but internally
	it uses the index array pointer, so that CPU does not send
	duplicate vertex information to GPU.

	
	** API for custom figure menu palette.

	Canvas::InstallPalette2D(mode, palette): define palette for 2D mode
	Canvas::InstallPalette3D(mode, palette): define palette for 3D mode

	mode : name of palette
	palette : definition of palette

	FigAxes::useFigurePalette2D(mode):  declare to use a palette
	FigAxes::useFigurePaletteStd2D(mode):  use default palette
	FigAxes::useFigurePalette3D(mode):  declare to use a palette
	FigAxes::useFigurePaletteStd3D(mode):  use default palette

	Various improvement of OpenGL graphics, which are needed
	for Petra-M
	
	** array_idx keywords to 3D solid and plot command

	array_idx is a number assigned to markers in a plot mode
	or line/triangle/rectangle in solid plot

	array_idx can be used to tell which part of 3D object is clicked.
	an element of array_idx should be between 1 and 65535

	** ArtGL::set_gl_pickable
	This can be used in order to make GL artist
	temporarilly unpickable.

	** ArtGL::LineGL caches marker texture.

	** ArtGL::get_gl_arrayid_hit
	Returns the array_idx of the elements which a user
	clicked.

        ** ArtGL::set_gl_hl_use_array_idx
	If True is give, it highlights of a part GL artist using
	array_idx data.

        ** Axes3DMod::gl_hl_setcolor
	Change highlith color. Giving [1,0,0] shows highlight in red

	** OIT (order independent transparency) renderer is enabled.
	** Videoplayer button relocation.

	A technique used to place buttons in figure canvas
	would be useful for placeig other palette-like buttons.
